# Poetry Generator
Takes an external text file (*.txt), and creates a list of each and every unique word in the text. Then, an output is generated. The number of words in the output is selected by the user, via altering the code.

This is a work-in-progress. I created it to generate some random text, and to come up with some poetry and/or prose, in the spirit of William S. Burroughs's "cut-up" method and other experimental styles.

Enjoy!
